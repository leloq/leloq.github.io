## Welcome

Hi, I'm Leo Semmelmann, a postdoctoral researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) focusing on bringing flexibility to modern power markets. This encompasses work on control strategies, trading algorithms, forecasting and policies. I have especially worked with battery storage systems and heat pumps, but am also excited to look at new and upcoming technologies.

### Research Areas

- Heat pump flexibility and control strategies
- Battery energy storage optimization
- Load forecasting with machine learning
- Policy design for dynamic tariffs and flexibility potentials
