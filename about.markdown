## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at **Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT)** with a strong focus on heat pump and battery flexibility. My research bridges energy economics and computer science to support the ongoing energy transition.
Besides my interest in learning new things and building software solutions, I enjoy playing tennis and beach volleyball, hiking the alps and improving my Risotto-cooking skills.
