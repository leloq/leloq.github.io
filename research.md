## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of energy economics, technology, and behavioral science, with applications to the ongoing energy transition. Key areas include:

### Smart Grids & Distribution Networks

I investigate how flexible loads—particularly heat pumps and battery storage—can support grid stability and reduce peak demand. My work includes grid modeling, expansion cost analysis, and the design of regulatory frameworks that encourage efficient flexibility utilization.

### Heat Pump Flexibility & Control

Heat pumps represent a critical flexibility resource for integrating renewable energy. I develop:

- **Predictive control algorithms** for optimized heat pump water heater operation
- **Synthetic load profiles** using k-means clustering to understand residential heat pump behavior
- **Demand forecasting models** that capture heat pump impact on energy communities

### Battery Energy Storage Systems

I model and analyze battery trading strategies on intraday energy markets, including:

- **Continuous intraday market bidding frameworks** for energy storage
- **Rolling intrinsic battery trading algorithms**
- **Peak shaving strategies** to reduce local and global grid peaks
- **Self-consumption optimization** for household battery systems

### Load Forecasting & Machine Learning

I develop hybrid machine learning approaches for accurate load prediction:

- **LSTM-XGBoost hybrid models** for energy community forecasting
- **Kernel density estimation** for large-scale probabilistic heat pump load forecasting
- **Privacy-preserving forecasting** using Learning to Rank XGBoost
- **Smart meter data analytics** with extensive feature engineering

### Dynamic Electricity Tariffs

My doctoral research addressed how dynamic (time-varying) electricity tariffs influence consumer adoption and grid outcomes, bridging policy design, technological requirements, and behavioral responses.

### Energy Informatics & Data Science

I apply advanced data science techniques to energy systems, including:

- Renewable energy price forecasting
- Investment decision support systems
- Large-scale energy data analysis
- Privacy-preserving analytics for smart meter data
